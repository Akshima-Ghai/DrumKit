# DrumKit

This is build on Javascript technology and this projects help me get a clear understanding of many new topics, which were hard to understand on the first go , but after creating this project , it became easy to handle such difficult and important topics including DOM(Document Object model),CALLBACK,HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS, JAVASCRIPT OBJECTS,ADD EVENT LISTENER,BUTTONS ,KEYPRESSES AND also slight understanding of Animation as well.
These 7 boxes are 7 buttons which represent 7 different voices/tunes of drum if we click on each box , a different sound will produce and thus we can create and enjoy our own created music not only that , also if we click keyboard keys corresponding to each button , then also out fav sound will be produced.
